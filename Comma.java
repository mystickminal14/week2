/*write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from
the user, where the user enters a comma in the input. Then print the
number without a comma. Here is a sample dialog:
Please enter an integer between 1,000 and 999,999: 23,456
23456
Hint: Read the input as a string. Measure the length of the string.
Suppose it contains n characters. Then extract substrings consisting of
the first n â€“ 4 characters and the last three characters.
